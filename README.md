# WinnerOdds Bookmaker Analyzer

Curious about your performance across different bookmakers but unsure how to organize or extract data from your personal WinnerOdds .csv file? Then this open-source, user-friendly .csv analyzer _(with a GUI)_ is perfect for you!

Currently working with tennis data only, but I am planing to add support for both soccer and table tennis shortly.
